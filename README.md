## 5. 🎯 Strategic Recommendations & Actionable Insights

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can help drive future growth:

1.  **Optimize Monthly Marketing Spend:**
    *   📌 **Recommendation:** Re-allocate marketing budget from peak months like **June** (where demand is already high) to underperforming months like **July and September**. Launch targeted campaigns during these "off-peak" months to smooth out the sales curve.

2.  **Double Down on Key Markets:**
    *   🌐 **Recommendation:** Increase investment in the **USA and Australian** markets through localized marketing campaigns and loyalty programs. Explore lookalike audiences in these regions to expand the customer base.

3.  **Leverage Price as a Strategic Tool:**
    *   💰 **Recommendation:** Since **Price** is the main driver, continue to run competitive pricing promotions. Introduce product bundling (e.g., a Mountain Bike with a Helmet and a Repair Kit) to increase the average order value while still offering a perception of great value.

4.  **Focus on High-Performing Product Categories:**
    *   🚲 **Recommendation:** Ensure that top-selling products like **Road and Mountain Bikes** are always in stock. Use them as the heroes of marketing campaigns and feature them prominently on the website's homepage.
